Todo:
- [ ] find nice icons for frontpage
- [ ] document (local) setup
- [ ] document setting up docs with vitepress (without duplicating vitepress docs)
- [ ] API&docs versioning
- [ ] integrate into upstream repo
- [ ] trigger on release


Bug Report:
* [ ] public folder need for statis assets
* [ ] Sidebar next/prev requires leading '/', but sidebar works without

Done:
* [x] create custom sidebar navigation
* [x] header
* [x] footer
* [x] search
* [x] frontpage layout
* [x] revert index.md
* [x] check frontmatters, delete unnecessary stuff
* [x] check settings (last edited, edit on gh, …)
* [x] get next/prev working
* [x] fix index.md, remove md/API examples from generator
* [x] style (according to HeiGIT corporate design guidelines)
* [x] set prev/next for "getting started" or include in sidebar

Other ideas
* [x] Algolia search?
      Not considered anymore, one would have to create an account…
