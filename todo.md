Todo:

* [x] create custom sidebar navigation
* [x] header
* [x] footer
* [x] search
* [x] frontpage layout
* [ ] find nice icons for frontpage
* [x] revert index.md
* [ ] check frontmatters, delete unnecessary stuff
* [x] check settings (last edited, edit on gh, â€¦)
* [x] get next/prev working
* [x] fix index.md, remove md/API examples from generator
* [x] style (according to HeiGIT corporate design guidelines)
* [ ] document (local) setup
* [x] set prev/next for "getting started" or include in sidebar

* [ ] integrate into upstream repo
* [ ] trigger on release

Other ideas
* [ ] API&docs versioning
* [ ] Algolia search?


Bug Report:
* [ ] public folder need for statis assets
* [ ] Sidebar next/prev requires leading '/', but sidebar works without
